# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

This is the third project of Udacity's Nanodegree Program.

# Tech Used
* HTML
* Canvas
* CSS

# Concept
This game is similar to Froger. The player needs to navigate the grid using up, down , left and right arrow keys. The player must avoid all bugs. If player collides with any bugs, they are reset to the starting possition. Once the player reaches the water, they officially win and the game resets.
